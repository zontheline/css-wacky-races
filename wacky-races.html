        <h1>24 hours of Lemons, the real Wacky Races</h1>
        <p>In America’s answer to Le Mans, the cars cost no more than $500, the contestants are amateur and the mood is
            resolutely zany.</p>

        <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/d9b15d6b-0b54-40e1-969e-3c47652c465c" rel="author">Adam Lashinsky</a> <time
            datetime="2024-05-06">May 6 2024</time>

        <p>My first impression of the goofily named 24 Hours of Lemons race competition is the dead-serious din of
            automobiles roaring by at upwards of 100mph. I am standing behind a chain-link fence at the three-mile
            Thunderhill Raceway Park, just outside the northern California town of Willows. The scene is at once bucolic
            – the complex is surrounded by acres of pink-blossomed almond trees and lies between a pair of snow-peaked
            mountain ranges – and deafening. The air is filled with the persistent roar of speeding <a
                href="https://www.ft.com/cars-bikes-planes-boats">cars</a> bereft of mufflers and
            the occasional pop of a backfiring engine.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, to call the vehicles whizzing past “race cars” is charitable at best. This exhibition is as
            amateur as&nbsp;can be. Here is a down-on-its-luck white Volkswagen Beetle, an ambitious spoiler rising from
            its rear and dark-black eyeballs painted on its headlights. There is a brown coupé with a toy
            stuffed-leopard on its hood and a hand-drawn sign on its grill, pointing downward, that reads: “TOW”. An
            otherwise sporty number has a three-tiered wedding cake affixed to its top.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>It’s at once a legitimate race and an exhibition of pure, zany, hobbyist joy. Everything about <a
                href="https://24hoursoflemons.com/">24 Hours of Lemons</a> is a wry play on the
            high-stakes world of race-car driving, including its name, a send-up of the French “grand prix of endurance
            racing”, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Races are held throughout the year across the United States, and
            four-driver teams pay $1,775 to enter. (A valid driver’s licence is the only requirement, though “whiners
            are not eligible to compete”, according to the rules.) Crucially, entrants must prove they’ve assembled
            their cars for no more than $500. “Lemons is the cheapest way of getting the most time on a&nbsp;real
            racetrack,” says Ewan Benefield, a 20-year-old from the San Francisco Bay Area and Lemons regular. There are
            stakes at play, just not particularly high stakes. The two-day competition is broken down into three
            classes: A (cars with a prayer of winning), B (cars with a prayer of finishing), and C (cars with no prayer
            of finishing). The Class C winner gets the biggest cash prize, a princely $600.</p>

        <p>The race I’ve come to see on a sunny Saturday in early spring is called “Jank of the West 2024”. In addition
            to the different classes, there also are a handful of judged awards, including “Winner on Index of
            Effluency”, defined as the best performance of the worst car. But there aren’t any losers at&nbsp;24 Hours
            of Lemons. “Everybody’s just here for the giggles,” Jay St Claire, an investor and contractor in Seattle,
            tells me. The organisers take safety seriously. All cars undergo a pre-race safety check, and drivers wear
            protective gear and are subject to various rules, including forced trips to an off-track “penalty box” for
            infractions such as driving off the course, making contact with another car and ignoring a yellow warning
            flag. Crashes happen – it’s a car race – but precautions on the track are at least as important as all the
            fun gimmicks.</p>

        <p>Lemons is the brainchild of Jay Lamm, a former automotive journalist who had become disenchanted with an
            amateur car-racing world that took itself far too seriously. “Historically, car racing was all about
            separating the heroes from the schlubs,” he tells me. Lamm is 59, bald and preternaturally tanned. He is
            also my wife’s cousin, which is how I came to know about his racing franchise. He started the business
            nearly 20 years ago and is something of a legend among car enthusiasts, a PT Barnum surrounded by acolytes
            who pay him for the privilege of performing.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><strong>It became increasingly clear</strong> to me that the hobby had been commercialised and made into a
            hierarchy that was all about money,” he says. “I jokingly put together a street race where the cars couldn’t
            cost more than $500.” That single race grew into a national series of closed-course competitions, concours
            and city-to-city rallies. Silliness aside, Lemons is an impressive business. The $1,775 entrance fee, which
            includes up to four drivers, is its main revenue source. Lemons also charges for additional drivers and
            non-drivers in the pit crew. Tickets for spectators are available too, drivers pay an annual membership fee,
            and Lemons makes some money selling merchandise. Lamm thinks of it as “beer-league softball for people who
            are interested in car racing, not baseball”. A sense of humour at Lemons is more important than the
            not-particularly-strict cost limit on the cars. Lamm’s employees wear orange T-shirts that read: “This is
            our circus. These are our monkeys.” An official sign on a racetrack fence says: “24 HOURS OF LEMONS: Racing
            for real people.” The arbitrary nature of the class assignment is part of the fun. Says Lamm: “We have a
            saying here: we pull the classes out of our asses.”</p>

        <p>His customers enjoy being in on the joke. Jay Morrison, the ringleader of a team that fields a 2002 Porsche
            Boxster, won’t say how much his car cost beyond revealing “we paid bribes because it’s a Porsche”. Morrison
            works in sales for a technology consulting firm called Convergint. One of the things he likes most about
            Lemons is the way competing teams help each other out with inevitable&nbsp;breakdowns. “We’re trying to keep
            each other in the race,” he says. His team’s car – “it’s really four cars salvaged” – has been assigned to
            the A class and had been doing well until&nbsp;Morrison took his turn behind the wheel. “We were in the top
            10 until I screwed it up,” he says. “We have the&nbsp;car to win but not the talent.”</p>

        <p>One entry, made up of students at Sierra College, a&nbsp;community college at the edge of the foothills of
            the nearby Sierra Nevada mountain range, doesn’t even seem to have a car to stay in the running. When I
            visit the Sierra College pit, the engine has been removed from their Mini Cooper, which has run only 17 laps
            that day. The students are investigating an electrical issue.</p>

        <p>The college kids have been getting some help from a&nbsp;driver whose skill and resources are at the opposite
            end of the Lemons spectrum. Renae Lamb has been racing in&nbsp;Lemons events for seven years. She is the
            owner, with her father, of an automotive repair shop in Sacramento that specialises in high-end European
            models. Her entry, a 1983 Porsche 944, definitely cost more than $500, especially because it has an upgraded
            engine under the hood (a certain amount of bribery at the qualification stage is part of the Lemons’
            tradition). Lamb is around cars all day for her job, but driving them on a racetrack is another thing
            altogether. “It is the single most fun thing I&nbsp;do,” she says. “When you’re out there, nothing matters.”

        <p>The happy-go-lucky car nuts I have met at Thunderhill&nbsp;are the spiritual children and grandchildren of
            the
            auto-obsessed California teenagers described by Tom Wolfe in his essay <em>There Goes (VAROOM! VAROOM) That
                Kandy Colored (THPHHHHHH!) Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby (RAHGHHHH!) Around the Bend
                (BRUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...)</em>. “They are freedom, style, sex, power, motion, colour – everything is
            right
            there,” he wrote in <em>Esquire </em>in 1963. And while there isn’t much sex in the air today, all the other
            qualities Wolfe observed 60 years ago are present in the paddock.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In the end, a Class A team from San Jose driving a 1998 BMW 318i places first among 99 total entrants,
            completing
            an impressive 330 laps. (Four unfortunate cars never made it around the track once.) A 1993 Mazda Miata from
            Santa Cruz won the B class, finishing fifth overall. The Class C honours went to a car older than many of
            the
            drivers on the course, a 1973 Chevy El Camino SS driven by a team from Sacramento.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Lemons is overwhelmingly male and equally middle-aged. But the kids from Sierra College more than represented
            the
            next generation. Their Notta Miata car made it back onto the course on Sunday. And one of its crew, a
            welding
            enthusiast named Erica Snow, earned the affection of multiple teams by wandering from pit&nbsp;to&nbsp;pit
            with
            her welder, offering much-needed mechanical assistance. This would&nbsp;never happen in Le Mans.&nbsp;</p>
